# Responsive Portfolio

I first used individual elements from bootstrap to create the navbar and cards on the main portfolio page. I then customized many features of each until I liked the layout. I used formatting and documentation I found online to make the page and the images responsive. Once I did that I entered the links to the other about.html and contact.html pages so that the navbar links would work. 

## About Page

On this page I used a snippet of code found on bootstrap to make a whole page responsive. I then deleted all elements on the page other than the nav bar and started fresh. I added a jumbotron with a small about section and then entered the links for the other html pages in the navbar section. 

### Contact

Finally, I created the contact page with the same formatting for the navbar that I used on the about page. I deleted all sections and added a jumbotron, along with a form section. Then I added all of the links to the other html documents within that navbar div as well. 

#### Overall, I think this excercise was awesome. The reason I say it was awesome was because it forced me to experiment with different things. I was actually able to read through the code and understand it and that was a really cool feeling.
